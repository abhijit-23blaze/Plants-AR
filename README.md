## About PlantPedia

PlantPedia is an innovative Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).

### The Problem

The knowledge and use of medicinal plants in AYUSH systems face several challenges in the modern world:

1. **Limited Accessibility:** Many people, especially in urban areas, have limited access to physical herbal gardens or direct experience with medicinal plants.

2. **Knowledge Gap:** There's a growing disconnect between traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and younger generations, leading to a potential loss of this valuable information.

3. **Identification Difficulties:** Accurately identifying medicinal plants can be challenging for non-experts, leading to potential misuse or missed opportunities for their application.

4. **Lack of Engaging Educational Tools:** Traditional methods of learning about medicinal plants often fail to capture the interest of people.
   
5. **Standardization Issues:** There's often a lack of standardized, easily accessible information about the proper cultivation, harvesting, and use of medicinal plants.

6. **Limited Interactive Experiences:** Most existing resources for learning about AYUSH medicinal plants lack interactive elements that can enhance understanding and retention.

These challenges collectively create a significant gap between users and the wealth of knowledge about AYUSH medicinal plants, hindering the preservation and application of this valuable traditional knowledge in modern healthcare practices.
